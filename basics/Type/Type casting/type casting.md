# type casting

## NOTE
1. About alias of type.

         (integer) is an alias of the (int) cast. 
         (boolean) is an alias of the (bool) cast. 
         (binary) is an alias of the (string) cast. 
         (double) and (real) are aliases of the (float) cast. 

          These casts do not use the canonical type name and are not recommended.
