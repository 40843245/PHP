# case-sensitive
## Objectives
In this article, we will discuss what something is case-sensitive, what is NOT and why?

## Case Sensitive
  
    Strings
    Variables
    Object Properties
    Constants, by default

## Case Insensitive
    
    Key Words etc
    Functions
    Object Methods
    Constants, if defined accordingly
    Class Names

## Mixed bag
    Classes
    
    class keyword is case insensitive
    
    Class names are case insensitive, for declaration, instantiation, and static calls
    
    Class methods, being functions, are case insensitive
    
    Class properties, being variables & constants, are case sensitive
    
    Because Strings are case sensitive, anything that relies on strings, such as array keys and values, is also case sensitive
